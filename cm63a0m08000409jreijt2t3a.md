Letâ€™s start with networking; So, If we see the networking we basically have to transport data from one machine to another machine. There are 7 layers between transporting data from one machine to another machine which is knows as **Model OSI**.

Letâ€™s understand the layers one by one so we can understand it briefly:

1. ### Physical layer

    If you donâ€™t know there are lot of connection cables laid on the seabed in the oceans which allow data to transfer from one to another continent and through the *Cable Landing Station (CLS)* they go throughout the whole continent and towers then it receives and send through mobiles towers to the data link layer. Itâ€™s basically the bits 1 & 0â€™s which transfer in the form of light in the cables. <mark>So, how does these bits transfer into readable data? </mark> ðŸ˜‰ For this we have to move on to the data link layer.
    
2. ### Data Link Layer

    This layer is responsible for the delivery of data (frames) from one node to another node which also includes encoding, decoding and organizing the outgoing data, also major role of this layer is to make sure data is delivered error free. <mark>So, do know the answer how this layer knows where the data must be sent? ðŸ¤”</mark> Yes, Itâ€™s the mac address; As you know every device has their own unique mac address which this layer add in the headers of each frame and thus they know where to send it. letâ€™s move on to the network layer.
    
3. ### Network Layer

    Here your home routers maintain crucial role to build the network layer or you can say your smartphone because it basically your phone which connects directly to the cell tower. Hmm, the main purpose of the network layer is for maintaining the routing, forwarding and addressing the data; This layer manages addressing the data through IP addresses and handles packet forwarding(creation â†’ transport â†’ packets assembly).
    
4. ### Transport layer

    This is the interesting part because here **we can control this layer.** <mark>Wanna know how?</mark>ðŸ¤¨
    
    This layer provides communication services for the application; It manages the error flow, full data transfer and based on your application services you can control the protocol you want. **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) and **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) are the two default protocols which you can define to manage your data transfer. You want reliability, can choose TCP, if you want low latency you have UDP. Both have their pros and cons, or you can make your own protocol as Zoom. Letâ€™s move on to the application layer.
